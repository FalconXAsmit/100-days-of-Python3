# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

Welcome to my repository for "100 Days of Code" challenge! This is my public commitment to learning and mastering Python by building 100 unique projects over 100 days.

This repository serves as a complete log of my journey, containing every project, note, and milestone. The goal is to go from the fundamentals to building real-world applications in web development, data science, automation, and more.

## 💻 My Progress Log

I'll be checking off each day's learning and project as I complete them. You can follow my progress here and explore the code for each project in the `projects` directory.

**And with that, the beginner section of the course is done. I'm happy to say I completed it with only a few hiccups, learning some huge lessons while building all these cool projects. My main takeaway? Connecting the grind to my ego has been a insane for my level up. I know ego is bad, but it has one upside—it makes the impossible feel doable. For the last 15 days after college, my mind keeps shouting: "I have to complete this days challenge, or I'm cooked." That pressure is what pushed me through. Now, the beginner phase of my #100DaysOfCode challenge is complete. Tomorrow, with full motivation, I'm diving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Thanks for following the journey.**
